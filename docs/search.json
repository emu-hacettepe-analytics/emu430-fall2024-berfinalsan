    "text": "My first assigment has two parts:\n\n\nHere is the video I have watched: [Veri Bilimi ve Endüstri Mühendisliği Üzerine Sohbetler - Baykal Hafızoğlu & Erdi Daşdemir] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV_0pHSdLAM&ab_channel=ErdiDasdemir)\nSummary\nFirst, Baykal Hafızoğlu introduced himself, sharing details about his academic background, work experience, and personal interests. He discussed various projects he had been involved in and mentioned that he was both the creator and developer of a program called Supply Chain Solver. Next, he delved into the world of data analytics, breaking it down into four categories: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive. He even likened Prescriptive Analytics to a doctor writing a prescription. He linked these categories of analytics to industrial engineering courses, highlighting the significance of understanding these connections. Then, he discussed analytical methods and solutions, offering examples from daily life to illustrate analytical approaches. He also shared insights from his experiences, recommending that one should always begin by clearly defining the problem. Furthermore, he suggested revisiting the original problem definition after completing the work to ensure clarity. Lastly, he answered questions from students.\n\n\n\nMultiple choice question:\n1) What are the 4 main headings of looking at the world of analytics?\n\nDescriptive, Diagnostic, Statistical, Operational\nPredictive, Prescriptive, Diagnostic, Descriptive\nQuantitative, Qualitative, Descriptive, Predictive\nOperational, Prescriptive, Statistical, Predictive\n\nAnswer: B\nOpen-ended question:\n2) In predictive analytics, when are simulation, regression, machine learning, and clustering techniques preferred, and what advantages does each provide?\nAnswer: Simulation, regression, machine learning, and clustering are preferred in predictive analytics under different circumstances: Simulation: Ideal for testing potential future scenarios. Regression: Shapes predictions by analyzing relationships between variables. Machine Learning: Increases prediction accuracy in large datasets. Clustering: Supports analyses like customer segmentation by identifying similar groups. Each technique enhances the effectiveness of analyses in specific contexts.\n\n\n\nIn the second part of the assignment, I have completed some tasks:\n\nImport the “polls_us_election_2016” data set from the dslabs package.\n\n’’‘{r chunk_1} library(dslabs) data(“polls_us_election_2016”)’’’\n\nDisplay the first 10 rows of the data set.\n\n’’‘{r chunk_2} first_ten_row &lt;- head(polls_us_election_2016,10) print(first_ten_row)’’’\n\nCalculate and display the total number of NA values in the entire data set.\n\n’’‘{r} total_na &lt;- sum(is.na(polls_us_election_2016)) total_na’’’\n\nReplace all NA values in the “polls_us_election_2016” data set as follows: For numeric columns, replace NA values with your birth year.
